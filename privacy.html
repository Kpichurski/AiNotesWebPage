          </p>

          <h3>Usage Data:</h3>
          <p>
            We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve our AI models 
            and app performance. This data is aggregated and cannot be linked 
            to individual users or their note content.
          </p>

          <h3>Local Storage:</h3>
          <p>
            The app stores your notes and preferences locally on your device, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your notes, text, voice recordings, and images</li>
            <li>AI-generated tags and categories</li>

            <li>Search history and favorites</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>We use collected information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide AI-powered note organization and categorization</li>
            <li>Generate smart summaries and key points extraction</li>
            <li>Enable intelligent search across your notes</li>

            <li>Sync your notes across your devices</li>
            <li>Provide personalized note-taking suggestions</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your note content 
            to third parties. We may share aggregated, anonymous data for 
            research purposes to improve note-taking technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our
            rights, property, or safety.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            Your notes are protected using enterprise-grade encryption both 
            in transit and at rest. We implement industry-standard security 
            protocols to protect your data from unauthorized access.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Your notes are stored locally on your device and in encrypted cloud 
            storage (if you choose to enable sync). You can delete your notes 
            at any time, and they will be permanently removed from our systems.
          </p>

          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Our app is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect 
            personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or 
            guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal 
            information, please contact us.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            AiNote may use third-party AI services for note processing and 
            organization. These services are bound by strict privacy agreements 
            and do not retain your note content beyond processing.
          </p>

          <h2>AI Processing</h2>
          <p>
            Our AI technology processes your notes to provide organization, 
            summarization, and search capabilities. This processing is done 
            securely and your content is not used to train other users' models.
          </p>

          <h2>Cloud Sync</h2>
          <p>
            If you choose to enable cloud sync, your notes are encrypted and 
            stored securely in the cloud. You can disable sync at any time 
            and your notes will remain only on your device.
          </p>
